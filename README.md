# Welcome!

This repository contains mainly data analysis performed on a course. Most of the code has slight changes from the course content in order to analyse this of that. 

Two of the analysis are compleely original: 
- deaths_all: data taken from WHO on total number of deaths per country. Data used to check how covid impacted several countries.
- plotlydf: script made to plot with plotly any pandas dataframe through a dash app where the user can select which columns to use for plotting as x or y axes.
